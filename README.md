# stockVolatility
Code to calculate N-day volatility acording to Augen. The entry point is volatilitystocks.m

Jeff Augen presents a convincing argument for using stock volatility, or the N-day volatility, as an indicator for making certain option trades. The code along with the book helped me make decent returns on stocks which, interestingly, have low volatility using Iron Condors. One challenge I faced was scaling up my tactic since an Iron Condor requires both a put and a call spread, which is hard to find in higher quantites. I do not do option trades any longer but would be curious about a possible solution. Please feel free to reach out with suggestions.
